# Acoustic-Sources-
Jupyter Notebook containing class definitions for a 2D acoustic environment and monopole source. 

Future work will allow multiple sources of different types to be defined in a space. The resulting pressure and particle velocity 
fields may be visualised, preferably as an animation.
